## How to push to linwebprod
After cloning this repository, type the following inside of the repository to add the remote:
```git remote add web YOUR_OLIN_USERNAME@linwebprod:/home/flin/hfid```

To push to linwebprod, type:
```git push web master```
Enter your Olin network password when prompted.

The folder permissions are hopefully right, but if you run into problems, let me (Franton) know!

This is a git hooks test. Yay!
