    <h2>Project Brief</h2>


    <h3>Scenario and rough design idea</h3>
    <p><b>Before:</b> James is new to his town and is trying to find voter registration information for his new state. He goes online to his government's website and spends 15 minutes trying to find forms under the confusing navigation. He tries to call the office, but it's closed and only opens three days a week. James works full time, and can't make the timings work for his schedule. He becomes incredibly frustrated with the process as his voter registration deadline looms closer.</p>

    <p><b>After:</b> James complains about his voting frustrations on the phone with his friend. His friend advises him to visit a new site he's heard of, opensite.gov. James tries the site and immediately loves the intuitive navigation. A chat box appears and asks what James is looking for. James says he wants to register to vote, and the form automatically pops up. James starts inputting his information and it auto-fills all the necessary fields. He confirms the information, clicks submit, and receives confirmation that he has updated his voter registration. Along with this, he also gets information about his polling location, election dates, and elected officials. James leaves the site feeling relieved that the process went smoothly, and has the information he needs for his next steps.<p>

    <h2>Value Proposition</h2> 
    <p>Government information is difficult to find and understand. Our project aims to make this information more accessible to the average citizen and offer it in a more human way.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>We're starting off with a broad user group of public citizens. If we see a specific need for one type of information (such as school information, voting information, water quality, etc.), we will narrow down. We will start off with user interviews, and perhaps government advocacy groups for specific issues. Example questions are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you visited the website for your local/state government?  Why/why not?</li>
        <li>If you have visited the website, did you find it intuitive?  Why/why not?  Were you able to find the information you needed quickly and easily (or at all)?</li>
        <li>What issues do you care about? Why? Could the government help?</li>
        <li>What don't you care about, and what could make you care?</li>
        <li>What government information do you wish you had access to?</li>
        <li>Is government transparency important to you? Why?</li>
        <li>Could you sketch your ideal interface for a local/state government website?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
    <p>Our team will work together by using a light agile approach. We'll use sprints, and have standups, sprint retros, etc. We all want quick prototyping and to be involved in the design process. We can pair design between meetings, and come to the meetings with designs prepared for feedback and decision making.</p>
