## Group Ideation

### Siri
Siri provides a new natural language, spoken, conversational interface for inquiring about and obtaining information. Brings up relevant information cards and links out.

Google provides information in a very readable and concise manner for certain search terms (e.g. "voting in Massachusetts").

Crowd sourcing information that changes non-regularly and fairly frequently could be a potentially useful way to create a community and keep information up to date.

### [Whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
Good design, easy to use. Provides way to interact through petitions.

### [Vox.com](http://www.vox.com/)
News website that does a great job at explaining difficult concepts in a very visual manner.

### [Yelp.com](https://www.yelp.com/)
Manages a large set of data that changes very often in a way that is easily accessible for the majority of people.

### [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

An immigration website that currently exists. Though the design is not current or accessible, this is our starting point for content and information.

## Individual Write-ups

### Siri - Aaron
Using natural language, you can ask Siri anything and it will try to bring up the relevant information. Having a personality and the ability to speak in complete sentences makes Siri easy to communicate with. There are troubles that arise from using Siri in public, as we are often not as comfortable talking to a computer in front of others. Siri also pulls relevant information cards that give a visual addition to the audio that is spoken. These interactive cards provide a clean and uncluttered interface. There is also an option to get more information and link out to other resources if you cannot find the information you are looking for in the simplified version.

### Wikipedia - Franton
Wikipedia is an example of how crowdsourcing information can be extremely successful and powerful. Even though no single person is responsible of keeping track of the information, Wikipedia pages remain incredibly up-to-date and relevant. This is because Wikipedia has a huge community of passionate users who maintain the information. Crowdsourcing information about immigration could be a way to keep the information up to date, potentially in multiple languages. The downside of crowdsourcing is that it can be hard to get off the ground and may not always be consistent. Wikipedia's homepage is also extremely language and user friendly, with many options for languages immediately displayed and a search bar that usually brings the user directly to a page with information. Taking cues from Wikipedia by having many languages up front and search bar navigation may help us to create a user friendly interface. Each of Wikipedia's pages, however, are often very dense with text and not necessarily the easiest to read.

Touchscreen building directories are great examples of how to provide strictly relevant information via a simple, intuitive interface. They typically reside in the lobbies of large, commercial buildings and list the names of businesses within the building and the floors and suite numbers at which they reside. They will usually also show the locations of restrooms, telephones, cafeterias, parking, and other services within the building. In some cases, they even show a weather forecast, which can be useful for commuters planning their trip home or their trip to work the next day. 

The touchscreens themselves are large, and their interfaces typically include a list of every business and service within the building. The combination of convenient location, limited information, and intuitive interface means that you don't have to go searching for the information you need -- it's just there. We can draw inspiration from these qualities, as this is the kind of experience we want to emulate in our project.

### Google Search - Radmer

	<figcaption>Example of a Google Search "best" answer card</figcaption>
</figure>
With Google search, all questions you have can be answered in a generally definitive way. If I were to type a question such as "what is the weather," Google search presents the "best" answer in a card at the top of the page, giving me a clear, direct answer to the question I asked. "Best" is still relative, however, as what makes it into the card is either a Google tailored graphic, like for the weather question, or content from the top response. However, to the user it feels as if Google knows what question was asked and tailored its display accordingly. Also even if I leave off information necessary to answer the question asked like my location, Google search will still be able to answer it by pulling in more information than I provided in the search bar. For our concept, users should feel the answers we provide are definitive in this same way. That might mean we want to borrow the concept of a card containing the "best" answer or something similar to this. We might also want to use similar dynamic graphics or visualizations in our product as those help provide more details to the user.

### The Work Department - Shrinidhi
The Work Dept speaks to the accessibility component of our project. The Work dept is a women-led design consultancy based in Detroit, that makes complex information easy to understand. Their chart below visualizes a family's qualification for several financial aid options. The infographic is friendly (bright colors and happy emojis) and accessible (large fonts and simple wording).

The Work Dept. also works directly with our user group. Many of their past works are targeted to low income, immigrant parents. These projects are both in both English and Spanish (an example is shown below). This is a reminder to us that having multiple languages is very important to our product.
