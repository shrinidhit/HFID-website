## Design Brief
#### What problem are you proposing to solve?

For those who are entering the country for an extended time, getting the right information can be a challenge. Wading through the long PDFs and forms on the United States' immigration website to understand what is needed as part of the entry process is difficult, because many lack the ability or confidence in their English skills to complete them. Once the person has arrived in the States things get no better, as they are greeted with a different culture and lack the tools to find information they ought to know. It is worse for families entering the country, as their needs are many, ranging from finding a new doctor to a new school for their children.

#### Who matters?

Our goal is to alleviate many of the difficulties in finding information for immigrants or those entering the country for an extended period of time. This will have benefits for a number of people, by directly helping those who seek to enter the United States for an extended period of time, their family and friends, and by indirectly helping businesses that hire immigrants.

#### How do your prospective users think about this problem/activity?

Most people would rather not have to interact with these services at all. Almost every person we interviewed said they had a negative time getting an American ID at the Department of Motor Vehicles or struggled with the forms required to get a visa. In addition, the one person who didn't struggle with problems involving government information avoided it entirely by relying on his wife to deal with them.

#### What requirements must your solution satisfy?

And yet, there are some problems involving government information that cannot be avoided for an immigrant. Thus, our solution should try as much as possible to reduce the interactions or headaches involved with trying to interact with government resources and services. In addition, because many immigrants struggle with English, our solution needs to reduce friction as much as possible for non-English speakers using it.

#### What will the impact of a successful solution be?

With a successful solution, an individual should walk away with a renewed appreciation in the functions of government and its ability to get get things done. In the future, our solution should become the first stop to for information or completing tasks involving the government.

## Narrative

Emily is excited and nervous about graduating college and going to work at Ernst & Young. As an international student, she remembers that she needs to apply for a social security number. Upon initial searching online, she is confronted with a slew of information and forms she needs to fill out and submit. As with the visa process, the multiple forms and timeline are somewhat confusing to Emily. She brings her completed forms and necessary documents to a nearby Social Security office, but is unsure that she filled out everything correctly. No one that she knows well has gone through this process previously, as many of her friends are US citizens. After a week, Emily still has not heard back from the Social Security office, and she begins to stress about whether she had forgotten part of the process or incorrectly filled out one of the forms. The next day, she receives an email from the Social Security office, telling her that her information is done processing and she can pick up her social security card at the front desk. Feeling extremely relieved that nothing went wrong, Emily is glad she does not have to go through the process again.
