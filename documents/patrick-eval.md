1. **H1 Visibility of system status (Severity 3)**<br>
The progress indication circles at the top of the page are good navigational tools, but the differentiation of blue for ‘in-progress’ and green for ‘complete’ wasn’t initially clear to me.

2. **H1 Visibility of system status (Severity 2)**<br>
I am unable to see a more detailed picture about my overall progress through the application - exactly what tasks I’ve completed, what tasks I haven’t completed, and how I’m doing timewise regarding my progress through the application process.

3. **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 3)**<br>
I was expecting to be able to click on the indication numbers at the top of the page to move backwards and forwards, but was unable to do so.

4. **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 4)**<br>
How can I save my progress? These steps require a lot of prior work that I may not have completed, and it’s not immediately clear that my data will be saved - this isn’t the norm with most forms online at least.

5. **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 4)**<br>
What am I supposed to do if I can’t do work on one task, but I want to work on other tasks - am I just supposed to wait? To my untrained eye, the tasks don’t seem to be entirely dependent. As a user, I feel like I should be able to start thinking about and researching future tasks at the very least

6. **H4 Consistency and Standards (Severity 4)**<br>
When moving to the last page, ‘School Requirements’, all of the previous indicator circles that used to be green are now black - this would seem to indicate my progress has not saved.

7. **H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design (Severity 2)**<br>
When signing up, it’s not immediately clear to me why my nationality is required - as far as I could tell, this information wasn’t used in the rest of the interface.

8. **H10 Help and documentation (Severity 2)**<br>
The information presented on the ‘Proof of Financial Support’ page, presented as one large block of rather small text, was not very intuitive or easy to parse through

**Overall Review:**<br>
Overall, it’s looking very promising - you’ve done a great job with visibility and affordance - it’s immediately clear to me as a user where I am, and what my options are. The design is looking professional and clean, a prime job so far with H4 and H8. With some additional attention to the user’s experience and the usability around saving and reviewing their progress, I think you’ll be in a great place. Keep it up!
