1.  **H2 Match between system and the real world (Severity 1)**<br>
    During the proof of financial support statement, there are some of the expenses being described that may not be very clear to the user. Users may have to leave your site to look for these definitions.

2.  **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 4)**<br>
    In the interface, the user is unable to move forward and back through the steps without using their browser buttons. There is no way to go back if accidently checking a box and continuing.

3.  **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 4)**<br>
    In the School Requirements interface, there is no option given to remove steps. In addition the “add another step” feature is ill-defined in the prototype making it unclear how one would specify the name of the step.

4.  **H7 Flexibility and efficiency of use (Severity 1)**<br>
    The only real accelerator is the login part, which only seems to only take one to the acceptance part of the application. Instead, a landing page of some sort would allow for returning users to speed up their interaction and allow them to tailor their actions to their status.

5.  **H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design] (Severity 1)**<br>
    The Proof of Financial Support step has a spelling error in the title. “Proof of Fininancial Support” -> “Proof of Financial Support”

6.  **Miscellaneous**<br>
    Good minimalist design, could benefit from more fleshing out of functions since the lack of freedom in the prototype does not help in accurately judging the design. The accelerator seems to be a bit weak, could benefit from a summary landing page.
