1.  **H3 User Control & Freedom (Severity 4)**<br>
User does not have the ability to go back or skip certain sections if they don’t have the documentation. As a user I sometimes want to see what other documents I need to gather ahead of time and then go back to what I was working on.

2.  **H6 Recognition Rather than Recall (Severity 2)**<br>
When I logged back into the system I was on Step 3 but there should be a clear way for me to see what steps 1 and 2 were.

3.  **H10 Help & Documentation (Severity 3)**<br>
The interface immediately jumps to part 1 of “Passport” and mentions that we will require to have a passport before completion” but there’s no process overview of what I should expect once I gather my passport (think Table of Contents).

4.  **H4 Consistency and Standards (Severity 1)**<br>
The recommended start dates should be all located in the same place in Steps 1 & 2 it’s located next to the header name, but in Step 3 it is located under the header name.

5.  **H4 User Control and Freedom ​(Severity 4)**<br>
When I am adding my list of items for school requirements users may not know all the requirements and want to “save” their work. There is no button that assures that their work will be “saved” or deleted if they exit the page.

6.  **H6 Help and Documentation (Severity 2)**<br>
Users are unable to retrieve password if they forgot it.

7.  **H1 Visibility of System Status (Severity 4)**<br>
User does not create a username and password when they create a new account. How can I log in when I return to re-visit the site?

8.  **H1 Visibility of System Status (Severity 3)**<br>
If I am colorblind how can I tell the difference between the green and blue circles? They are similar shades. Is there a way you can indicate your progress other than color? Perhaps making the circle you’re on bigger?

**Comments:**<br>
Overall I think you do a great job on H2 (Match Between Systems and the Real World) by explaining concepts, documents and examples of these documents. I like that you keep consistent terms to “save documents” and specify which documents will be needed for your I20. Your “Continue” buttons allow users to review their work before progressing to the next step.
Your use of font size and headers being bold provide clear instructions of what that page is about, but the room for improvement can be thinking about how users can move between these headers, saving progress on each of these tasks and, remembering what the progress circles stand for once a user completes it, and better defining what stage of the process you’re on (re-thinking how to use colors, and if there are alternative options to indicate progress other than blue & green colors)
Great job Badlands! Can’t wait to see your next prototype.
