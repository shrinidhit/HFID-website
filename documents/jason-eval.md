### Like

The application provides an amazingly concise interface the helps user through out the process of I-20 application. Each page provides great visibility of required documents and suggestions. As an international student myself, I feel the app will be a great help to students applying for I-20 forms.

### Problem

1.  **H1 Visibility of system status (Severity 1)**<br>
    The current interface doesn't allow user to be aware of the all the documents needed or what kinds of document to be expected in the following steps. Instead of naming each step 1, 2, 3 and 4, more detailed names such as passport, financial support and etc might be more favorable.

2.  **H2 Match between system and the real world (Severity 3)**<br>
    The log in panel on the home page doesn't have a sign up button. The interface gives user the option to sign in but not to register. Also the current interface doesn't have explanation for the benefit of register as user, whether it's for recording personal info, get premium service and etc.

3.  **H3 User control and freedom (Severity 2)**<br>
    The interface doesn't provide user the option to go to the previous step (or jump to any of the step). A button for going back on each of the step should be necessary.

4.  **H4 Consistency and standards (Severity 2)**<br>
    On some of the steps the checklist says “attach to your I-20 request” but on some of the pages, the description says “XX is required before filling out the I-20”. I'm confused about whether user Is preparing for requesting I-20 or filling it out.

5.  **H6 Recognition rather than recall (Severity 1)**<br>
    The current interface requires user to remember himself on each of the step about what documents need to be added to the I-20 application, a summary of all the documents to be sent out at the end would ease user the pain to review every single page of the app about what needs to be sent.
