1.  **H4 Consistency & Standards (Severity 1)**<br>
    You misspelled the word “passport”. You spelled it “passpot” on the Passport tasks page. It’s important to keep this consistent as this is one of the major tasks of you application.

2.  **H4 Consistency & Standards, and H10 Help and documentation (Severity 3)**<br>
    On the introduction page, I am informed this application will help me organize my F-1 visa process. On the next page, the timeline is for an I-20, and suddenly I-20 is everywhere. I, personally, don’t know the difference between an I-20 and an F-1. I’m not sure if someone coming to study here in the US might know the difference either if the I-20 and F-1 forms are specific to the US. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a section or blub about what’s the difference, and how they’re related. After introducing them to both legal documents, I think it would be okay to go from F-1 to I-20, but right now that’s confusing.

3.  **H1 Visibility of System Status (Severity 2)**<br>
    I really like the timeline header above the application, it’s a great start at providing visibility of system status. I also really like the signifier of which step I am currently on. However, currently those are just numbers and they don’t mean very much. They could perhaps be more beneficial if I as a user knew what I was going to do in that step before I got to the step. Perhaps adding title headers to each number would help make them more than numbers, but rather more defined goals and tasks.

4.  **H3 User control and freedom and H6 Recognition rather than recall (Severity 3)**<br>
    Again, I like the timeline header above the application, this does a great job of providing visibility of system status. However, I would like a case to be able to go switch between sections, or at least back to see the information I previously entered in case I forgot since this is often a long term process.

5.  **H4 Consistency & Standards (Severity 1)**<br>
    You guys broke consistency on the School Requirements page by saying “Please keep these documents in a safe place” instead of “Please keep these documents in a safe place, you will need it for your request for an I-20”. Will I not need these documents for my I-20 request? If so, maybe be more explicit?

6. **H6 Recognition rather than recall (Severity 2)**<br>
    On the proof of financial support page, the application says that I as a user should look on my school’s website for an I-20 request form. This seems like a pretty important thing, too important to put in a parenthesis, perhaps this should be a task somewhere?

Overall, my comments are more about consistency and recognition. I really like the timeline at the top. I, as a user, would also perhaps appreciate my progress through the steps. Some might take more time than others, so it would be great to know how much more I have left to go. I appreciate your minimalism compared to normal government websites because they are normally so crowded with information. Great work team!
