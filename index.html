      <h2>Inspirational Designs</h2>
        <h3>Group Ideation</h3>
          <h4>Siri</h4>
            <p>Siri provides a new natural language, spoken, conversational interface for inquiring
              about and obtaining information. Brings up relevant information cards and links out.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a></h4>
            <p>Google provides information in a very readable and concise manner for certain
              search terms (e.g. "voting in Massachusetts").</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></h4>
            <p>Crowd sourcing information that changes non-regularly and fairly frequently could be a
              potentially useful way to create a community and keep information up to date.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse.gov</a></h4>
            <p>Good design, easy to use. Provides way to interact through petitions.</p>
          <h4><a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox.com</a></h4>
            <p>News website that does a great job at explaining difficult concepts in a very visual manner.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp.com</a></h4>
            <p>Manages a large set of data that changes very often in a way that is easily accessible for the majority of people.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a></h4>
            <p>Provides access to large government datasets in a searchable way.
              More of a direct competitor than inspiration as it doesn't do its job amazingly.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.boston.gov/">Boston.gov</a></h4>
            <p>Revamped government website that provides relevant and recent
              information in an easy to navigate and visually pleasing manner.</p>
          <h4>Logan Touchscreen</h4>
            <p>Scan ticket to see route to gate. New forms of input.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.voteplz.org/">Voteplz.org</a></h4>
            <p>Easy interface to see if you are registered to vote, and to guide you through the process.</p>
          <h4>The Swedish Number</h4>
            <p>Connect to a random Swede. Get different perspectives.</p>
          <h4>City Hall to Go</h4>
            <p>Boston city hall to go lets people accomplish their government tasks without going to city hall. It comes to them.</p>
          <h4><a href="http://www.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas.gov</a></h4>
            <p>Has a large search box front and center, with trending search terms below.
              Makes it easy to go directly to what you're looking for.</p>
          <h4>Touchscreen Directory</h4>
            <p>Found in the lobby of a building.  Shows which companies, offices, departments, etc.
              are in the building and where they are located.</p>
          <h4><a href="http://www.immihelp.com/">Immihelp.com</a></h4>
            <p>An immigration website that currently exists. Though the design is not current or accessible,
              this is our starting point for content and information.</p>
          <h4>Slackbot</h4>
            <p>Has a little robot chat that asks you what you need help with and with what.
              Makes navigation feel a little more human and friendly (even though it's just a bot).</p>
          <h4><a href="http://www.theworkdept.com/">The Work Department</a></h4>
            <p>A communications design agency that make accessible brochures and media.

          <h4><a href="http://www.rockthevote.com/">RockTheVote.com</a></h4>
            <p>Autofills your information onto the voter registration form, that you can then print and send out.</p>

        <h3>Individual Write-ups</h3>
          <h4>Siri - Aaron</h4>
            <p>Using natural language, you can ask Siri anything and it will try to bring up the relevant information.
              Having a personality and the ability to speak in complete sentences makes Siri easy to communicate with.
              There are troubles that arise from using Siri in public, as we are often not as comfortable talking to a computer in front of others.
              Siri also pulls relevant information cards that give a visual addition to the audio that is spoken. These interactive cards provide a clean and uncluttered interface.
              There is also an option to get more information and link out to other resources if you cannot find the information you are looking for in the simplified version.</p>
          <h4>Wikipedia - Franton</h4>
            <p>Wikipedia is an example of how crowdsourcing information can be extremely successful and powerful. Even though no single person is responsible of keeping track of the
              information, Wikipedia pages remain incredibly up-to-date and relevant. This is because Wikipedia has a huge community of passionate users who maintain the information.
              Crowdsourcing information about immigration could be a way to keep the information up to date, potentially in multiple languages. The downside of crowdsourcing is that
              it can be hard to get off the ground and may not always be consistent. Wikipedia's homepage is also extremely language and user friendly, with many options for languages
              immediately displayed and a search bar that usually brings the user directly to a page with information. Taking cues from Wikipedia by having many languages up front and
              search bar navigation may help us to create a user friendly interface. Each of Wikipedia's pages, however, are often very dense with text and not necessarily the easiest
              to read.</p>
          <h4>Touchscreen Building Directory - Haley</h4>
            <img src="images/touchscreen_bd_1.png" alt="Touchscreen BD">
            <img src="images/touchscreen_bd_2.png" alt="Touchscreen BD UI">
            <p>Touchscreen building directories are great examples of how to provide strictly relevant information via a simple, intuitive interface. They typically reside in the
              lobbies of large, commercial buildings and list the names of businesses within the building and the floors and suite numbers at which they reside. They will usually
              also show the locations of restrooms, telephones, cafeterias, parking, and other services within the building. In some cases, they even show a weather forecast, which
              can be useful for commuters planning their trip home or their trip to work the next day. The touchscreens themselves are large, and their interfaces typically include
              a list of every business and service within the building. The combination of convenient location, limited information, and intuitive interface means that you don't
              have to go searching for the information you need -- it's just there. We can draw inspiration from these qualities, as this is the kind of experience we want to emulate
              in our project.</p>
          <h4>Google Search - Radmer</h4>
            <img src="images/google_search.png" alt="Google Search">
            <p>With Google search, all questions you have can be answered in a generally definitive way. If I were to type a question such as "what is the weather,"
              Google search presents the "best" answer in a card at the top of the page, giving me a clear, direct answer to the question I asked. "Best" is still relative,
              however, as what makes it into the card is either a Google tailored graphic, like for the weather question, or content from the top response. However, to the
              user it feels as if Google knows what question was asked and tailored its display accordingly. Also even if I leave off information necessary to answer the question
              asked like my location, Google search will still be able to answer it by pulling in more information than I provided in the search bar. For our concept, users
              should feel the answers we provide are definitive in this same way. That might mean we want to borrow the concept of a card containing the "best" answer or
              something similar to this. We might also want to use similar dynamic graphics or visualizations in our product as those help provide more details to the user.</p>
