  <h2>Design Development</h2>

  <h4>Shortcomings of Our Approach (From Needs Analysis Phase)</h4>
  <p>One shortcoming of our approach in the Needs Analysis phase was that we
    decided on a problem to solve based on limited knowledge of our users. We
    started out with a rough idea for our user group: immigrant families looking
    for schools for their children. After spending some time trying to find users
    to interview, we realized that this group would not be easily accessible to
    us. Given the time constraints of this phase of the course, we decided to
    pivot to a more accessible user group that was in the same vein as the first:
    international and exchange students going through the paperwork process for
    studying in the U.S. Because it took us a while to come to this realization
    and to pivot our target user group, we ended up with even less time than
    expected to interview users. The information that we collected was based
    on limited information from a small set of initial user interviews. Thus,
    the need that we had chosen to address and our initial ideas for solutions
    may not have been as strong as they would have been otherwise. We aimed to
    address this during the Design Development phase, adjusting our solution and
    possible implementations accordingly as we did user testing.</p>

  <h4>Process Overview</h4>
  <p>Last phase, we narrowed down our problem to assisting international and
    exchange students with the Visa process for entering the United States.
    This phase, we tried out multiple interfaces in order to find the elements
    of a design we could move forward with. To do this we created multiple paper
    prototypes and led users through similar tasks in the Visa process for each
    one. From these usability studies, we collected feedback and synthesized the
    results into a final design. We will summarize our findings below.</p>

  <h4>Prototype One: Timeline</h4>
  <p>In our usability study with the timeline prototype, we tasked users to
    complete their I-20 form, which is the form an institution gives approving
    each user's study there. They completed a form to determine what Visa they
    needed and what path they should take to get it. Following that, the users
    were presented with a timeline containing tasks represented by cards. Cards
    could be clicked, and a information panel would appear at the bottom of the
    screen with more details. In the bottom panel, the user could check a box
    marked done to complete the task. Some tasks had prerequisites, and so if
    they clicked the card before the prerequisite tasks were completed, the done
    box would be replaced with an x preventing them from completing in.</p>
  <br>
  <p>From our usability studies, we found that there were many points of confusion
    with this prototype. First, users were confused on what the prototype's
    purpose was. Did it complete my application for me? Was it to walk me through
    the process or to keep track of where I was like a checklist? Second, the
    timeline page was overwhelming at first. Users spent a lot of time
    familiarizing themselves with layout before working on tasks. Part of that
    was also the confusion of how the bottom panel was connected to the cards on
    the timeline and whether the cards themselves were clickable. Finally, users
    also felt there was not enough context behind each task and too few details
    on how to complete them. Users did appreciate how start and stop dates were
    expressed, but they did not seem to care much about spacing along the
    timeline representing time.</p>

  <h4>Prototype Two: List of Steps and Chat Pairing</h4>
  <p>With our list-based and task-oriented prototype, we asked users to go
    through a sample Visa application that we had broken up into achievable
    steps. All the tasks necessary to complete the Visa form were on the left
    on the interface. When a user clicked on a task, the selected task would
    appear on the right and provide steps to complete it. Upon completion, the
    user could continue to the next step. If the user prefered to complete a
    task that was easier, rather than the one that was next, they could complete
    that one first, provided there were no prerequisites. Once a task was
    completed, a green check mark would appear next to it. If a user had a
    question, they could click on the chat icon in the lower right. This icon,
    when clicked, would open a chat window where the user could choose from
    people who had gone through a similar process and were available to chat.
    The user could then ask the person any questions, and once the issue was
    resolved, close the window.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In our studies using the list of steps prototype with assistance provided by
    pairing users at different stages in the process, we found that the task-based
    system was well-received, but users were not interested in the chat option.
    Users liked they could clearly see the tasks they had to complete. They also
    liked that while there was clearly a suggested order to complete them in, they
    could choose a step out of order if it seemed easier to complete. For steps
    that required a form be filled out, the form would auto-fill based on the
    information that the user put in. Users liked the because it made it much
    easier to fill out the form. Users were at first confused about the order in
    which the steps were placed, and so an important iteration would be to have
    the finished tasks on the top.</p>
  <br>
  <p>While our initial conversations with users seemed to point to a feature that
    would allow the user to connect with another person that had gone through a
    similar process, this ended up not feature that users were interested in. This
    may be in part because the users who had had someone help them knew the person
    that was helping them personally. Having a stranger help them with their form
    did not appeal to the users. Users were more likely to consult a FAQ, Google,
    or an administrator rather than the chat.</p>

  <h4>Prototype Three: Chat</h4>
  <p>We also tested a chat/messenger based prototype with our users. Users were
    tasked to also complete up to their I-20 form. Users completed each task step
    by step as a narrator walked them through the task to complete. When forms or
    photos of documents were required, a input bubble would pop up allowing the
    user to add the image needed with the app also validating it to make sure it
    was correct.
  <br>
  <p>However, in walking users through the prototype, like when we walked them
    through the timeline, users were confused whether the app was actually
    completing their application for them or just walking them through completing
    it. In addition, users questioned how far along they were in the process,
    which we did not show in our prototype.</p>

  <h3>Final Design</h3>
  <p>We noticed from our paper prototypes that there was confusion among our
    users about what the prototype was actually doing, so we aimed to solidify
    that in our final design. Our design is for managing the Visa application
    process. It does not complete the application for the user. It takes elements
    from both of our prototypes that users liked: the left to right layout of the
    timeline, and the expanding panel from the list of steps. We also use bubble
    size on the timeline to express subtasks of a larger task.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In our card sorting exercise and in our usability test, Users showed they
    care a lot about the timing of tasks--when they should start them and when
    are they due--the context around tasks, how to complete a task, and what are
    the prerequisites of a task. Our design meets all of these by having a
    recommended start date and a deadline for each large task or milestone, by
    having lots of room on the expanding panel for a description of why this step
    is necessary and how to complete it, and by having a linear progression with
    size indicating that the larger bubble needs the smaller bubbles to be
    finished first.</p>

  <h3>Key Insight</h3>
  <p>In trying to produce a design that addresses our brief, we realized that
    people were not particularly fond of our chat pairing prototype. We were
    surprised by this, because in our initial round of user testing during the
    Needs Analysis phase, we heard from a few users that they liked to read blogs
    online by people who had been through the process before. People also seemed
    to generally react positively to the idea of connecting with other people
    going through the process at the same time as them.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When we asked users why they did not like this feature, they said that they
    did not trust random strangers who just happened to be using the app at the
    same time as them to answer their questions. They did not believe that these
    people would necessarily have enough knowledge to be able to help them with
    anything, since they also had not been through the process yet. One user
    said that they didn't want the app to be like a "social network." What we
    learned from this was that we were trying to solve two separate needs with
    one prototype, and those two needs didn't mesh together particularly well.
    While our user group might enjoy and benefit from a social network-type app,
    they do not want this to be a part of their Visa application process. The
    insight that we gained from this is that it is best to design for just one
    need at a time.</p>

  <h3>Shortcomings</h3>
  <p>We noticed from our paper prototypes that there was confusion among our
    users about what the prototype was actually doing, so we aimed to solidify
    that in our final design. Our design is for managing the Visa application
    process. It does not complete the application for the user. It takes elements
    from both of our prototypes that users liked: the left to right layout of the
    timeline, and the expanding panel from the list of steps. We also use bubble
